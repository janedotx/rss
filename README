The code is deployed to http://li911-253.members.linode.com/. In case it crashes, daemontools will restart it.

A few thoughts:
1. I went with using a form to star articles, but that's obviously silly. The best thing from a UI perspective would be to use
AJAX on each of the check boxes to issue a POST to the API. The API, such as it is.
2. I decided to not store every article in the database, as RSS readers are inherently sampling from a neverending stream of
data, most of which does not need to persist. (I don't need the 'starred' column if I continue with this approach, as merely
saving an article in the DB indicates it's starred.)
3. I've never used an RSS reader, but it seems like the kind of thing someone would keep open in a tab all the time. If so, 
one useful and fun feature to implement would be for the reader to refresh itself with new content.
4. Obviously this needs tests.
5. This is running on WEBrick right now, so that's why it's slow, sorry.
